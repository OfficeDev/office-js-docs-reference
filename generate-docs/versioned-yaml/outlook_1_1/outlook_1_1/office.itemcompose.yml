      Removes an attachment from a message or appointment.


      The removeAttachmentAsync method removes the attachment with the specified identifier from the item. As a best
      practice, you should use the attachment identifier to remove an attachment only if the same mail app has added
      that attachment in the same session. In Outlook Web App and OWA for Devices, the attachment identifier is valid
      only within the same session. A session is over when the user closes the app, or if the user starts composing an
      inline form then subsequently pops out the form to continue in a separate window.
