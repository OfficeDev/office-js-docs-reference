    summary: Represents a framework event that components can subscribe to.
    remarks: >-
      Examples of events in a web application might include: the user clicking a button, the system navigating to
      another page, or an item being added/removed from an abstract collection. The SharePoint Framework represents
      events using instances of the Event object, one for each kind of event. The Event object is typically exposed as a
      property of an associated class (e.g. the button that can be clicked). When a component is interested in an event,
      it calls add() to register an event handler callback that will be invoked each time the event occurs. The handler
      receives an EventArgs parameter that may provide additional details about what happened. This is analogous to the
      browser's Document Object Model (DOM) events. The main difference is the IEventObserver feature, which tracks
      which component subscribed to each event, and automatically unsubscribes the handler when the component is
      disposed.

       When an event is raised, all handlers are invoked synchronously. The order in which event handlers are called is unspecified. The event handler callback must catch any exceptions that occur during processing; an uncaught exception will not prevent other handlers from executing, but it will be reported as a problem with the associated component.

    remarks: >-
      The same object can add multiple event handlers to the same event. Since BaseComponent implements the
      IEventObserver interface, a web part or extension can pass itself as the observer. This will cause the event
      handler to be automatically unsubscribed when the web part or extension is disposed.

            Indicates the object that is subscribing to the event: When the object is disposed, the event handler will
            be automatically removed. This object is also used for diagnostic purposes, e.g. detecting if the event
            handler failed to catch an exception.
