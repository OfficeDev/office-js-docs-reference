# Task Pane API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

With the Task Pane API requirement set, you can manage the task pane of an add-in. For example, you can change the width of an add-in's task pane.
