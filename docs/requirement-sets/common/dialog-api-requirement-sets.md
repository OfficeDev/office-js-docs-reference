# Dialog API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Dialog API requirement sets, the supported Office client applications, and the **minimum** builds or versions for those applications where applicable.

| Requirement set | Office on Windows<br>(Microsoft 365 subscription) | Office on Windows\*<br>(retail perpetual Office 2016 or later) | Office on Windows\*<br>(volume-licensed perpetual) | Office on Mac | Office on iPad | Office on the web | Office Online Server |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| DialogApi 1.2 | See [support](#office-on-windows-microsoft-365-subscription-support)<br>[section](#office-on-windows-microsoft-365-subscription-support) | Version 2005 (Build 12827.20268) | Office 2021: Version 2005 (Build 12827.20268) | 16.37 | 16.37 | Supported | Not supported |
| DialogApi 1.1&dagger; | Version 1602 (Build 6741.0000) | Version 1602 (Build 6741.0000) | Office 2013: Build 15.0.4855.1000 | 15.20 | 1.22 | Supported | Version 1608 (Build 7601.6800) |

> [!NOTE]
> \* Users of perpetual versions of Office may not have accepted all patches and updates. If so, the DLL that Office uses to report its version in the UI may be greater than the versions listed here even if the updated DLLs needed to support DialogApi have not be installed on the user's computer. To ensure that the needed patch is installed, the user must go to the Office update list ([Office 2013 list](/officeupdates/msp-files-office-2013) or [Office 2016 list](/officeupdates/msp-files-office-2016)), search for **osfclient-x-none**, and install the listed patch.
>
> &dagger; Retail perpetual Office 2013 also supports DialogApi 1.1.

## Office on Windows (Microsoft 365 subscription) support

The DialogApi 1.2 requirement set is supported in the Consumer Channel from Version 2005 (Build 12827.20268). That requirement set is also supported in the Semi-Annual Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel builds available since June 9, 2020. The **minimum** supported builds for each channel are as follows:  

| Channel | Minimum version | Minimum build |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| Current Channel | 2005 | 12827.20160 |
| Monthly Enterprise Channel | 2004 | 12730.20430 |
| Semi-Annual Enterprise Channel | 2002 | 12527.20720 |

## Office Common API requirement sets

For information about Common API requirement sets, see [Office Common API requirement sets](office-add-in-requirement-sets.md).

## Dialog API 1.1 and 1.2

The Dialog API 1.1 is the first version of the API. Requirement set 1.2 adds support for sending data from the parent page to the dialog box with the [Office.dialog.messageChild](/javascript/api/office/office.dialog#office-office-dialog-messagechild-member(1)) method. For details about these APIs, see the [Dialog API](/javascript/api/office/office.ui) reference topic.
