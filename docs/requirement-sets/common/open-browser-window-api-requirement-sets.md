# Open Browser Window API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

The OpenBrowserWindow API set enables add-ins to open a browser to accomplish tasks that cannot always be done in the sandboxed webview control within the add-in itself; for example, downloading a PDF file when the webview control is provided by Microsoft Edge.

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the OpenBrowserWindow API requirement sets, the supported Office client applications, and the **minimum** builds or versions for those applications where applicable.

| Requirement set | Office on Windows<br>- Microsoft 365 subscription<br>- retail perpetual Office 2016 and later | Office on Windows<br>(volume-licensed perpetual) | Office on Mac | Office on iPad | Office on the web | Office Online Server |
