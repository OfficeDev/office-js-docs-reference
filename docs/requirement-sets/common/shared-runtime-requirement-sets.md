# Shared runtime requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

Parts of an Office Add-in that run JavaScript code, such as task panes, function files launched from add-in commands, and Excel custom functions, can share a single JavaScript runtime. This enables all the parts to share a set of global variables, to share a set of loaded libraries, and to communicate with each other without having to pass messages through a persisted storage. For more information, see [Configure your Office Add-in to use a shared JavaScript runtime](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime).

The following table lists the SharedRuntime 1.1 requirement set, the Office client applications that support that requirement set, and the build or version numbers for the Office application.

| Requirement set | Office 2021 or later on Windows<br>(one-time purchase) | Office on Windows<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription) | Office on iPad<br>(connected to a Microsoft 365 subscription) | Office on Mac<br>(both subscription<br> and one-time purchase Office on Mac 2019 and later)  | Office on the web | Office Online Server |
