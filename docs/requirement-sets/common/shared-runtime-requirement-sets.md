# Shared runtime requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

Parts of an Office Add-in that run JavaScript code, such as task panes, function files launched from add-in commands, and Excel custom functions, can share a single JavaScript runtime. This enables all the parts to share a set of global variables, to share a set of loaded libraries, and to communicate with each other without having to pass messages through a persisted storage. For more information, see [Configure your Office Add-in to use a shared JavaScript runtime](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/configure-your-add-in-to-use-a-shared-runtime).

The following table lists the Shared Runtime requirement sets, the supported Office client applications, and the **minimum** builds or versions for those applications where applicable.

## Office versions and build numbers

To find out more about versions, build numbers, and Office Online Server, see:

## Office Common API requirement sets

For information about Common API requirement sets, see [Office Common API requirement sets](office-add-in-requirement-sets.md).

## SharedRuntime API 1.1

The SharedRuntime API 1.1 is the first version of the API. For details, see the [Office.Addin](/javascript/api/office/office.addin) reference topic.

## SharedRuntime API 1.2

The SharedRuntime API 1.2 adds the [Office.BeforeDocumentCloseNotification](/javascript/api/office/office.beforedocumentclosenotification) interface, which helps ensure that workbooks don't close while an add-in process is running.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> SharedRuntime 1.2 is only supported in Excel.
