# Ribbon API requirement sets

Requirement sets are named groups of API members. Office Add-ins use requirement sets specified in the manifest or use a runtime check to determine whether an Office application supports APIs that an add-in needs. For more information, see [Office versions and requirement sets](/office/dev/add-ins/develop/office-versions-and-requirement-sets).

The Ribbon API set supports programmatic control of when custom add-in commands (that is, custom ribbon buttons and menu items) are enabled and disabled and when contextual tabs appear on the ribbon.

Office Add-ins run across multiple versions of Office. The following table lists the Ribbon API requirement sets, the supported Office client applications, and the **minimum** builds or versions for those applications where applicable.

| Requirement set | Office on Windows<br>(Microsoft 365 subscription) | Office on Windows<br>(retail perpetual Office 2016 or later) | Office on Windows<br>(volume-licensed perpetual) | Office on Mac | Office on iPad | Office on the web | Office Online Server |
|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|:-----|
| RibbonApi 1.2  | Version 2102 (Build 13801.20294) | Version 2102 (Build 13801.20294) | Office 2021: Version 2108 (Build 14326.20454) | 16.53.806.0 | Not supported | Supported | Not supported |
| RibbonApi 1.1  | See [support](#support-for-version-11-in-office-on-windows-microsoft-365-subscription)<br>[section](#support-for-version-11-in-office-on-windows-microsoft-365-subscription) | Version 2006 (Build 20266.20266) | Office 2021: Version 2108 (Build 14326.20454) | 16.38 | Not supported | Supported | Not supported |

## Support for version 1.1 in Office on Windows (Microsoft 365 subscription)

The 1.1 version of the RibbonApi requirement set is supported in the Consumer Channel from Version 2006 (Build 13001.20498). That requirement set is also supported in the Semi-Annual Channel and Monthly Enterprise Channel builds available since July 14, 2020. The **minimum** supported builds for each channel are as follows:

For information about Common API requirement sets, see [Office Common API requirement sets](office-add-in-requirement-sets.md).

## Ribbon API 1.1

The Ribbon API 1.1 is the first version of the API. For details about the API, see the [Office.ribbon](/javascript/api/office/office.ribbon) reference topic.

## Ribbon API 1.2

The Ribbon API 1.2 adds support for contextual tabs. For more information, see [Create custom contextual tabs in Office Add-ins](/office/dev/add-ins/design/contextual-tabs).

> [!NOTE]
> The **RibbonApi 1.2** requirement set is not yet supported in the manifest, so you shouldn't specify it in the manifest's **\<Requirements\>** section.
