# Outlook add-in API preview requirement set

The Outlook add-in API subset of the Office JavaScript API includes objects, methods, properties, and events that you can use in an Outlook add-in.

Preview APIs are subject to change and aren't intended for use in a production environment. We recommend that you try them out in test and development environments only. Don't use preview APIs in a production environment or within business-critical documents.

To use preview APIs:

- You must use the preview version of the Office JavaScript API library from the [Office.js content delivery network (CDN)](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.js). The [type definition file](https://appsforoffice.microsoft.com/lib/beta/hosted/office.d.ts) for TypeScript compilation and IntelliSense is found at the CDN and [DefinitelyTyped](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped/master/types/office-js-preview/index.d.ts). You can install these types with `npm install --save-dev @types/office-js-preview` (be sure to remove the types for `@types/office-js` if you've previously installed them).

- You may need to join the [Microsoft 365 Insider program](https://insider.microsoft365.com/join) for access to more recent Office builds in Outlook on Windows and on Mac.

- You may need to configure the **Targeted release** option on your Microsoft 365 tenant to preview features in Outlook on the web. For more information, see the "Targeted release" section of [Set up the Standard or Targeted release options](/microsoft-365/admin/manage/release-options-in-office-365#targeted-release).

The preview requirement set includes all of the features of [requirement set 1.13](../requirement-set-1.13/outlook-requirement-set-1.13.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This documentation is for a **preview** [requirement set](../outlook-api-requirement-sets.md). This requirement set isn't fully implemented yet, and clients won't accurately report support for it. You shouldn't specify this requirement set in your add-in manifest.
