# Outlook add-in API requirement set 1.12

The Outlook add-in API subset of the Office JavaScript API includes objects, methods, properties, and events that you can use in an Outlook add-in.

## What's new in 1.12?

Requirement set 1.12 includes all of the features of [requirement set 1.11](../requirement-set-1.11/outlook-requirement-set-1.11.md). It added the following features.

- Added new events for [event-based activation](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/autolaunch#supported-events).
- Added [send mode options](../../../manifest/launchevent.md#available-sendmode-options) for add-ins that use the `OnMessageSend` or `OnAppointmentSend` event.
- Added support to display an error message to the user in [event-based activation](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/smart-alerts-onmessagesend-walkthrough) add-ins.

### Change log

- Added new events for [event-based activation](/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/autolaunch#supported-events): Adds support for the following events.

  - `OnMessageSend`
  - `OnAppointmentSend`
  - `OnMessageCompose`
  - `OnAppointmentOrganizer`

- Modified the [LaunchEvent manifest element](/javascript/api/manifest/launchevent): Adds the `SendMode` attribute used by the `OnMessageSend` and `OnAppointmentSend` events. This attribute specifies options available to the user if an add-in stops an item from being sent or if the add-in is unavailable.
- Modified [Office.AddinCommands.EventCompletedOptions](/javascript/api/office/office.addincommands.eventcompletedoptions?view=outlook-js-1.12&preserve-view=true): Adds the `errorMessage` property to display a message to the user if `allowEvent` is set to `false` when the add-in's event handler condition isn't met.
