# What's new in Excel JavaScript API 1.8

The Excel JavaScript API requirement set 1.8 features include APIs for PivotTables, data validation, charts, events for charts, performance options, and workbook creation.

## PivotTable

Wave 2 of the PivotTable APIs lets add-ins set the hierarchies of a PivotTable. You can now control the data and how it is aggregated. Our [PivotTable article](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-pivottables) has more on the new PivotTable functionality.

## Data Validation

Data validation gives you control of what a user enters in a worksheet. You can limit cells to pre-defined answer sets or give pop-up warnings about undesirable input. Learn more about [adding data validation to ranges](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-data-validation) today.

## Charts

Another round of Chart APIs brings even greater programmatic control over chart elements. You now have greater access to the legend, axes, trendline, and plot area.

## Events

More [events](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/excel-add-ins-events) have been added for charts. Have your add-in react to users interacting with the chart. You can also [toggle events](/office/dev/add-ins/excel/performance#enable-and-disable-events) firing across the entire workbook.
