# What's new in PowerPoint JavaScript API 1.5

PowerPointApi 1.5 added APIs to select slides, text ranges, and shapes within presentations. Prior to this release, selecting slides and shapes required a complicated series of steps. These selection APIs enable developers to directly select slides, text ranges, and shapes, creating a more efficient and intuitive add-in development process.

## API list

The following table lists the PowerPoint JavaScript API requirement set 1.5. For a complete list of all PowerPoint JavaScript APIs (including preview APIs and previously released APIs), see [all PowerPoint JavaScript APIs](/javascript/api/powerpoint?view=powerpoint-js-preview&preserve-view=true).
