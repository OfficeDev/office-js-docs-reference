      In addition to this signature, this method has the following signatures:


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; }): Excel.WorkbookCreated` - Where option.select is a
      comma-delimited string that specifies the properties to load, and options.expand is a comma-delimited string that
      specifies the navigation properties to load.


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; top?: number; skip?: number }): Excel.WorkbookCreated` - Only
      available on collection types. It is similar to the preceding signature. Option.top specifies the maximum number
      of collection items that can be included in the result. Option.skip specifies the number of items that are to be
      skipped and not included in the result. If option.top is specified, the result set will start after skipping the
      specified number of items.

      Overrides the JavaScript `toJSON()` method in order to provide more useful output when an API object is passed to
      `JSON.stringify()`<!-- -->. (`JSON.stringify`<!-- -->, in turn, calls the `toJSON` method of the object that is
      passed to it.) Whereas the original Excel.WorkbookCreated object is an API object, the `toJSON` method returns a
      plain JavaScript object (typed as `Excel.Interfaces.WorkbookCreatedData`<!-- -->) that contains shallow copies of
      any loaded child properties from the original object.
