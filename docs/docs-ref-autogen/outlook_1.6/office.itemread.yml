      The getRegExMatches method returns the strings that match the regular expression defined in each

      ItemHasRegularExpressionMatch rule, a matching string has to occur in the property of the item that is specified

      If you specify an ItemHasRegularExpressionMatch rule on the body property of an item, the regular expression
      should further filter the body and should not attempt to return the entire body of the item. Using a regular
