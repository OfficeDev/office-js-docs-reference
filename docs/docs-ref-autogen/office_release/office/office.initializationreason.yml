  #### Examples


  ```TypeScript

  // You can use the value of the InitializationEnumeration to implement
  different logic for

  // when the add-in is first inserted versus when it is already part of the
  document.

  // The following example shows some simple logic that uses the value of the
  reason parameter

  // to display how the task pane or content add-in was initialized.

  Office.initialize = function (reason) {
      // Checks for the DOM to load using the jQuery ready method.
      $(document).ready(function () {
          // After the DOM is loaded, code specific to the add-in can run.
          // Display initialization reason.
          if (reason === Office.InitializationReason.Inserted) {
              write("The add-in was just inserted.");
          }

          if (reason === Office.InitializationReason.DocumentOpened) {
              write("The add-in is already part of the document.");
          }
      });
  }


  // Function that writes to a div with id='message' on the page.

  function write(message) {
      document.getElementById('message').innerText += message;
  }
