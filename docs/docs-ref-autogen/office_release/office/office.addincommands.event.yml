      **Important**:


      - The `options` parameter only applies to Outlook add-ins. It was
      introduced in Mailbox 1.8. Although Outlook on Android and on iOS support
      up to Mailbox 1.5, the `options` parameter is supported in online-meeting
      provider and note-logging mobile add-ins. For more information on API
      support in Outlook on mobile devices, see [Outlook JavaScript APIs
      supported in Outlook on mobile
      devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/outlook-mobile-apis)<!--

      and [integrated
      spam-reporting](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/spam-reporting)
      add-ins use a different event object to signal when they've completed
      processing an event. For more information, see
