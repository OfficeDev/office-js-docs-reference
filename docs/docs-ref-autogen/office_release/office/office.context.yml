      `commerceAllowed` is only supported in Office on iPad.


      The iOS App Store doesn't support apps with add-ins that provide links to
      additional payment systems. However, Office Add-ins running in Office on
      the Windows desktop or in the browser do allow such links. If you want the
      UI of your add-in to provide a link to an external payment system on
      platforms other than iOS, you can use the commerceAllowed property to
      control when that link is displayed.
