      This method is available in the DialogApi requirement set for Excel, PowerPoint, or Word add-ins, and in the
      Mailbox requirement set 1.4 for Outlook. For more on how to specify a requirement set in your manifest, see
      [Specify Office applications and API

      The initial page must be on the same domain as the parent page (the startAddress parameter). After the initial
      page loads, you can go to other domains.


      Any page calling `Office.context.ui.messageParent` must also be on the same domain as the parent page.


      **Design considerations**:


      The following design considerations apply to dialog boxes.


      - An Office Add-in task pane can have only one dialog box open at any time. Multiple dialogs can be open at the
      same time from Add-in Commands (custom ribbon buttons or menu items).


      - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.


      - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.


      - Dialog boxes appear on top of the application and in the order in which they were created.


      Use a dialog box to:


      - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.


      - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaskpane or ExecuteAction command.


      - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.


      Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.


      **displayDialogAsync Errors**


      <table> <tr> <th>Code number</th> <th>Meaning</th> </tr> <tr> <td>12004</td> <td>The domain of the URL passed to
      displayDialogAsync isn't trusted. The domain must be either the same domain as the host page (including protocol
      and port number), or it must be registered in the <code>AppDomains</code> section of the add-in manifest.</td>
      </tr> <tr> <td>12005</td> <td>The URL passed to displayDialogAsync uses the HTTP protocol. HTTPS is required. (In
      some versions of Office, the error message returned with 12005 is the same one returned for 12004.)</td> </tr>
      <tr> <td>12007</td> <td>A dialog box is already opened from the task pane. A task pane add-in can only have one
      dialog box open at a time.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>12009</td> <td>The user chose to ignore the dialog box. This error
      can occur in online versions of Office, where users may choose not to allow an add-in to present a dialog.</td>
      </tr> </table>


      In the callback function passed to the displayDialogAsync method, you can use the properties of the AsyncResult
      object to return the following information.


      <table> <tr> <th>Property</th> <th>Use</th> </tr> <tr> <td><code>AsyncResult.value</code></td> <td>Access the
      Dialog object.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>AsyncResult.status</code></td> <td>Determine the success or failure of
      the operation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>AsyncResult.error</code></td> <td>Access an Error object that provides
      error information if the operation failed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td><code>AsyncResult.asyncContext</code></td>
      <td>Access your user-defined object or value, if you passed one as the asyncContext parameter.</td> </tr> </table>
