    summary: >-
      When the completed method is used to signal completion of an event handler, this value indicates if the handled
      event should continue execution or be canceled. For example, an add-in that handles the `ItemSend` event can set
      `allowEvent` to `false` to cancel sending of the message.

          #### Examples

          ```javascript
          // The following example checks whether a location is specified in an appointment before it's sent.
          function onAppointmentSendHandler(event) {
              Office.context.mailbox.item.location.getAsync({ asyncContext: event }, asyncResult => {
                  let event = asyncResult.asyncContext;
                  if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
                      console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
                      // If the add-in is unable to retrieve the appointment's location, the appointment isn't sent.
                      event.completed({ allowEvent: false, errorMessage: "Failed to get the appointment's location." });
                      return;
                  }

                  if (asyncResult.value === "") {
                      // If no location is specified, the appointment isn't sent and the user is alerted to include a location.
                      event.completed({ allowEvent: false, errorMessage: "Don't forget to add a meeting location." });
                      return;
                  } else {
                      // If a location is specified, the appointment is sent.
                      event.completed({ allowEvent: true });
                  }
              });
          }
          ```
