  `EventCompletedOptions` object is supported in online-meeting provider and
  note-logging mobile add-ins. For more information on API support in Outlook on

      When you use the [completed
      method](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/office/office.addincommands.event#office-office-addincommands-event-completed-member(1))
      to signal completion of an event handler, this value indicates if the
      handled event should continue execution or be canceled. For example, an
      on-send add-in that handles the `ItemSend` event can set `allowEvent` to
      `false` to cancel the sending of a message.
