      - This property is currently in preview in Outlook on Windows. To test it in your add-in, you must install Version
      2401 (Build 17228.20000) or later. Then, join the [Microsoft 365 Insider
      program](https://insider.microsoft365.com/join/windows) and select the **Beta Channel** option to access
      Office beta builds.


      - The URL returned points to the location of the JavaScript file that Outlook on Windows uses to handle
      event-based activation and integrated spam reporting. To learn more about these features, see [Configure your

      [Implement an integrated spam-reporting add-in
      (preview)](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/spam-reporting)<!-- -->.


      - If your add-in uses the XML manifest, the URL returned matches the `resid` value of the **RuntimeOverride**
      element of type `javascript`<!-- -->. To learn more, see [Override element for
      Runtime](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/manifest/override#override-element-for-runtime)<!-- -->.
