  Specifies which properties of an object should be loaded. This load happens
  when the sync() method is executed. This synchronizes the states between
  Office objects and corresponding JavaScript proxy objects.
remarks: >-
  For Word, the preferred method for specifying the properties and paging
  information is by using a string literal. The first two examples show the
  preferred way to request the text and font size properties for paragraphs in a
  paragraph collection:


  `context.load(paragraphs, 'text, font/size');`


  `paragraphs.load('text, font/size');`


  Here is a similar example using object notation (includes paging):


  `context.load(paragraphs, {select: 'text, font/size', expand: 'font', top: 50,
  skip: 0});`


  `paragraphs.load({select: 'text, font/size', expand: 'font', top: 50, skip:
  0});`


  Note that if we don't specify the specific properties on the font object in
  the select statement, the expand statement by itself would indicate that all
  of the font properties are loaded.
