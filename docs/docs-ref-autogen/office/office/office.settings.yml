      Represents custom settings for a task pane or content add-in that are stored in the host document as name/value
      pairs.

      **Hosts**: Excel, PowerPoint, Word


      The settings created by using the methods of the Settings object are saved per add-in and per document. That is,
      they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.


      The name of a setting is a string, while the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.


      The Settings object is automatically loaded as part of the Document object, and is available by calling the
      settings property of that object when the add-in is activated.


      The developer is responsible for calling the saveAsync method after adding or deleting settings to save the
      settings in the document.

      **Important**: Your add-in's code can register a handler for the settingsChanged event when the add-in is running
      with any Excel client, but the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is opened in

      This method is useful in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint coauthoring scenarios when multiple instances of the same
      add-in are working against the same document. Because each add-in is working against an in-memory copy of the
      settings loaded from the document at the time the user opened it, the settings values used by each user can get
      out of sync. This can happen whenever an instance of the add-in calls the Settings.saveAsync method to persist all
      of that user's settings to the document. Calling the refreshAsync method from the event handler for the
      settingsChanged event of the add-in will refresh the settings values for all users.


      In the callback function passed to the refreshAsync method, you can use the properties of the AsyncResult object
      to return the following information.
