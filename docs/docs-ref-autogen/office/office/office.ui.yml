      [DialogAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/dialog-api-requirement-sets)


      The behavior of this method is specified by the following:


      - Called from a UI-less command button: No effect. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will remain open.


      - Called from a task pane: The task pane will close. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will also close. If
      the task pane supports pinning and was pinned by the user, it will be un-pinned.


      - Called from a module extension: No effect.

      **Requirement sets**:

      [DialogAPI](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/dialog-api-requirement-sets)


      - [Mailbox
      1.4](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/reference/requirement-sets/outlook-api-requirement-sets)


      This method is available in the DialogApi requirement set for Word, Excel, or PowerPoint add-ins, and in the
      Mailbox requirement set 1.4 for Outlook. For more on how to specify a requirement set in your manifest, see
      [Specify Office hosts and API
      requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/specify-office-hosts-and-api-requirements)<!--
      -->.


      The initial page must be on the same domain as the parent page (the startAddress parameter). After the initial
      page loads, you can go to other domains.


      Any page calling `Office.context.ui.messageParent` must also be on the same domain as the parent page.


      **Design considerations**:


      The following design considerations apply to dialog boxes:


      - An Office Add-in task pane can have only one dialog box open at any time. Multiple dialogs can be open at the
      same time from Add-in Commands (custom ribbon buttons or menu items).


      - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.


      - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.


      - Dialog boxes appear on top of the host application and in the order in which they were created.


      Use a dialog box to:


      - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.


      - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaskpane or ExecuteAction command.


      - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.


      Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.


      For a design pattern that you can use to create a dialog box, see [Client
      Dialog](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Client_Dialog.md) in
      the Office Add-in UX Design Patterns repository on GitHub.
