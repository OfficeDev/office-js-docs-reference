  ```TypeScript
  // This sample shows how to register an event handler in Outlook.
  Office.onReady(() => {
      // Registers an event handler to identify when messages are selected.
      Office.context.mailbox.addHandlerAsync(Office.EventType.SelectedItemsChanged, getMessageProperties, (asyncResult) => {
          if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
              console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
              return;
          }

          console.log("Event handler added for the SelectedItemsChanged event.");
      });
  });

  function getMessageProperties() {
      // Retrieves the selected messages' properties and logs them to the console.
      Office.context.mailbox.getSelectedItemsAsync((asyncResult) => {
          if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
              console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
              return;

      receives an argument of type
      [Office.DragAndDropEventArgs](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/outlook/office.draganddropeventargs)<!--
      -->.


      **Important**: The `DragAndDropEvent` event isn't supported in Outlook
      on Windows (classic) and on Mac. If the `DragAndDropEvent` handler runs on
      these clients, an error occurs ("This event isn't supported on this
      platform.").

      with a defined [custom
      action](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/outlook/office.notificationmessagedetails#actions)<!--
      -->. Currently, **Dismiss** is the only supported action that fires
      this event.


      To add an event handler for the `InfobarClicked` event, use the
      `addHandlerAsync` method of the `Item` object. The event handler receives
      an argument of type
      [Office.InfobarClickedEventArgs](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/outlook/office.infobarclickedeventargs?view=outlook-js-1.10)<!--
      -->.


      **Important**:


      - This event can only be handled in a task pane. Function commands can't
      register a handler for this event.


      - Although Outlook on Mac supports the `InsightMessage` notification type,
      it currently doesn't support the `InfobarClicked` event. To determine when
      the **Dismiss** action is selected from the notification, implement a
      handler for the `OnInfoBarDismissClicked` event instead. For more
      information, see [Activate add-ins with
      events](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/event-based-activation#supported-events)<!--
