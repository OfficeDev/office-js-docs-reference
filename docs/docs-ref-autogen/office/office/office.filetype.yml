      Returns the entire document (.pptx, .docx, .xlsx, or .xlsm) in Office Open XML (OOXML) format as a byte array.


      Note: The .xslm file type is supported in Excel on Windows and Mac. It's not supported in Excel on the web. In
      Excel on Windows, the file slices from the `getFileAsync` method include the VBA signature files for .xslm file
      types. The VBA signature files are vbaProjectSignature.bin, vbaProbjectSignatureAgile.bin, and
      vbaProjectSignatureV3.bin. In Excel on Mac, the file slices from the `getFileAsync` method don't include the VBA
      signature files, because this platform doesn't support the VBA signature feature.
