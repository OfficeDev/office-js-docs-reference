      This method is asynchronous. It does not take a callback parameter and it
      does not return a Promise object, so it cannot be awaited with either the
      `await` keyword or the `then` function. See this best practice for more
      information: [Opening another dialog immediately after closing
      one](https://docs.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/develop/dialog-best-practices#opening-another-dialog-immediately-after-closing-one)
