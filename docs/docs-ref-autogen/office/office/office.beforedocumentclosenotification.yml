      Adds an event handler that detects when the `BeforeDocumentCloseNotification` close operation is cancelled. This
      event handler will be triggered if one of the following conditions is met: 1. When the notification dialog is
      open, the end user clicks the **Don't close** button within the dialog, clicks the Close button in the upper right
      corner of the dialog, or presses the Esc key. 2. When the add-in calls the `enable` method on the
      `BeforeDocumentCloseNotification` object.
