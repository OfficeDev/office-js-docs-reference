    summary: >-
      Determines whether the dialog box should be displayed within an IFrame.
      This setting is only applicable in Office on the web, and is ignored by
      other platforms. If false (default), the dialog will be displayed as a new
      browser window (pop-up). Recommended for authentication pages that cannot
      be displayed in an IFrame. If true, the dialog will be displayed as a
      floating overlay with an IFrame. This is best for user experience and
      performance.

      Determines if the pop-up blocker dialog will be shown to the user.
      Defaults to true.


      `true` - The framework displays a pop-up to trigger the navigation and
      avoid the browser's pop-up blocker. `false` - The dialog will not be shown
      and the developer must handle pop-ups (by providing a user interface
      artifact to trigger the navigation).
