    summary: >-
      Determines whether the dialog box should be displayed within an IFrame. This setting is only applicable in Office
      on the web, and is ignored by other platforms. If false (default), the dialog will be displayed as a new browser
      window (pop-up). Recommended for authentication pages that cannot be displayed in an IFrame. If true, the dialog
      will be displayed as a floating overlay with an IFrame. This is best for user experience and performance.

      Determines if the pop-up blocker dialog will be shown to the user. Defaults to true.


      `true` - The framework displays a pop-up to trigger the navigation and avoid the browser's pop-up blocker. `false`
      - The dialog will not be shown and the developer must handle pop-ups (by providing a user interface artifact to
      trigger the navigation).
