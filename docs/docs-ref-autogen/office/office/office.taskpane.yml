      **Important**: The default width of the task pane of an add-in varies
      depending on the platform.


      - **Web (Excel)**: 350 px


      - **Web (Word)**: 330 px


      - **Windows, Mac**: 51 px


      If you pass a width beyond the minimum and maximum constraints, the task
      pane isn't resized and no error is shown.
