remarks: >-
  The behavior caused by the
  [options.selectionMode](xref:office!Office.SelectionMode:enum) option varies
  by host:


  In Excel: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects all content in the binding,
  or named item. `Office.SelectionMode.None` for text bindings, selects the
  cell; for matrix bindings, table bindings, and named items, selects the first
  data cell (not first cell in header row for tables).


  In PowerPoint: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects the slide title or
  first textbox on the slide. `Office.SelectionMode.None` doesn't select
  anything.


  In Word: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects all content in the binding.
  `Office.SelectionMode.None` for text bindings, moves the cursor to the
  beginning of the text; for matrix bindings and table bindings, selects the
  first data cell (not first cell in header row for tables).
