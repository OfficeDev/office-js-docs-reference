summary: >-
  Provides information about the settings that raised the settingsChanged event.


  To add an event handler for the settingsChanged event, use the addHandlerAsync method of the
  [Office.Settings](xref:office!Office.Settings:interface) object.


  The settingsChanged event fires only when your add-in's script calls the Settings.saveAsync method to persist the
  in-memory copy of the settings into the document file. The settingsChanged event is not triggered when the
  Settings.set or Settings.remove methods are called.


  The settingsChanged event was designed to let you to handle potential conflicts when two or more users are attempting
  to save settings at the same time when your add-in is used in a shared (coauthored) document.


  **Important**: Your add-in's code can register a handler for the settingsChanged event when the add-in is running with
  any Excel client, but the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is opened in Excel on
  the web, and more than one user is editing the spreadsheet (coauthoring). Therefore, effectively the settingsChanged
  event is supported only in Excel on the web in coauthoring scenarios.
