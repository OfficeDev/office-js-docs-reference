summary: >-
  Provides information about the settings that raised the settingsChanged event.


  To add an event handler for the settingsChanged event, use the addHandlerAsync
  method of the [Office.Settings](xref:office!Office.Settings:interface) object.


  The settingsChanged event fires only when your add-in's script calls the
  Settings.saveAsync method to persist the in-memory copy of the settings into
  the document file. The settingsChanged event is not triggered when the
  Settings.set or Settings.remove methods are called.


  The settingsChanged event was designed to let you to handle potential
  conflicts when two or more users are attempting to save settings at the same
  time when your add-in is used in a shared (coauthored) document.


  **Important**: Your add-in's code can register a handler for the
  settingsChanged event when the add-in is running with any Excel client, but
  the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is
  opened in Excel on the web, and more than one user is editing the spreadsheet
  (coauthoring). Therefore, effectively the settingsChanged event is supported
  only in Excel on the web in coauthoring scenarios.
