    summary: >-
      Optional. Causes Office to prompt the user to provide the additional factor when the tenancy being targeted by
      Microsoft Graph requires multifactor authentication. The string value identifies the type of additional factor
      that is required. In most cases, you won't know at development time whether the user's tenant requires an
      additional factor or what the string should be. So this option would be used in a "second try" call of
      getAccessTokenAsync after Microsoft Graph has sent an error requesting the additional factor and containing the
      string that should be used with the authChallenge option.

      changed or if the user's consent has been revoked.
