      For Excel, the itemName parameter can refer to a named range or a table.


      By default, adding a table in Excel assigns the name "Table1" for the first table you add, "Table2" for the second
      table you add, and so on. To assign a meaningful name for a table in the Excel UI, use the Table Name property on
      the Table Tools \| Design tab of the ribbon.


      Note: In Excel, when specifying a table as a named item, you must fully qualify the name to include the worksheet
      name in the name of the table in this format: "Sheet1!Table1"


      For Word, the itemName parameter refers to the Title property of a Rich Text content control. (You can't bind to
      content controls other than the Rich Text content control.)


      By default, a content control has no Title value assigned. To assign a meaningful name in the Word UI, after
      inserting a Rich Text content control from the Controls group on the Developer tab of the ribbon, use the
      Properties command in the Controls group to display the Content Control Properties dialog box. Then set the Title
      property of the content control to the name you want to reference from your code.


      Note: In Word, if there are multiple Rich Text content controls with the same Title property value (name), and you
      try to bind to one these content controls with this method (by specifying its name as the itemName parameter), the
      operation will fail.

      Adds the specified type of binding object to the Bindings collection, which will be identified with the supplied
      id.


      Note In Excel, if you call the addFromSelectionAsync method passing in the Binding.id of an existing binding, the
      Binding.type of that binding is used, and its type cannot be changed by specifying a different value for the
      bindingType parameter.If you need to use an existing id and change the bindingType, call the
      Bindings.releaseByIdAsync method first to release the binding, and then call the addFromSelectionAsync method to
      reestablish the binding with a new type.
