      Represents custom settings for a task pane or content add-in that are stored in the host document as name/value
      pairs.
    remarks: >-
      The settings created by using the methods of the Settings object are saved per add-in and per document. That is,
      they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.


      The name of a setting is a string, while the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.


      The Settings object is automatically loaded as part of the Document object, and is available by calling the
      settings property of that object when the add-in is activated. The developer is responsible for calling the
      saveAsync method after adding or deleting settings to save the settings in the document.
