      The settings created by using the methods of the Settings object are saved per add-in and per document. That is,
      they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.


      The name of a setting is a string, while the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.


      The Settings object is automatically loaded as part of the Document object, and is available by calling the
      settings property of that object when the add-in is activated.


      The developer is responsible for calling the saveAsync method after adding or deleting settings to save the
      settings in the document.

      This method is useful in Excel, Word, and PowerPoint coauthoring scenarios when multiple instances of the same
      add-in are working against the same document. Because each add-in is working against an in-memory copy of the
      settings loaded from the document at the time the user opened it, the settings values used by each user can get
      out of sync. This can happen whenever an instance of the add-in calls the Settings.saveAsync method to persist all
      of that user's settings to the document. Calling the refreshAsync method from the event handler for the
      settingsChanged event of the add-in will refresh the settings values for all users.


      In the callback function passed to the refreshAsync method, you can use the properties of the AsyncResult object
      to return the following information.


      <table> <tr> <th>Property</th> <th>Use to...</th> </tr> <tr> <td>AsyncResult.value</td> <td>Access a Settings

    remarks: >-
      Any settings previously saved by an add-in are loaded when it is initialized, so during the lifetime of the
      session you can just use the set and get methods to work with the in-memory copy of the settings property bag.
      When you want to persist the settings so that they are available the next time the add-in is used, use the
      saveAsync method.


      **Note**: The saveAsync method persists the in-memory settings property bag into the document file. However, the
      changes to the document file itself are saved only when the user (or AutoRecover setting) saves the document to
      the file system. The refreshAsync method is only useful in coauthoring scenarios when other instances of the same
      add-in might change the settings and those changes should be made available to all instances.

      Sets or creates the specified setting.


      **Important**: Be aware that the Settings.set method affects only the in-memory copy of the settings property bag.
      To make sure that additions or changes to settings will be available to your add-in the next time the document is
      opened, at some point after calling the Settings.set method and before the add-in is closed, you must call the
      Settings.saveAsync method to persist settings in the document.
    remarks: >-
      <table><tr><td>Requirement Sets</td><td>Settings</td></tr></table>


      The set method creates a new setting of the specified name if it does not already exist, or sets an existing
      setting of the specified name in the in-memory copy of the settings property bag. After you call the
      Settings.saveAsync method, the value is stored in the document as the serialized JSON representation of its data
      type. A maximum of 2MB is available for the settings of each add-in.
