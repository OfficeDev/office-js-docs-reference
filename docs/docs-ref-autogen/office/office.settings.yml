      The settings created by using the methods of the Settings object are saved per add-in and per document. That is,
      they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the document in which they are saved.


      The name of a setting is a string, while the value can be a string, number, boolean, null, object, or array.


      The Settings object is automatically loaded as part of the Document object, and is available by calling the
      settings property of that object when the add-in is activated. The developer is responsible for calling the
      saveAsync method after adding or deleting settings to save the settings in the document.

      Adds an event handler for the settingsChanged event.


      Important: Your add-in's code can register a handler for the settingsChanged event when the add-in is running with
      any Excel client, but the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is opened in
      Excel Online, and more than one user is editing the spreadsheet (co-authoring). Therefore, effectively the
      settingsChanged event is supported only in Excel Online in co-authoring scenarios.

      You can add multiple event handlers for the specified eventType as long as the name of each event handler function
      is unique.

      This method is useful in Word and PowerPoint coauthoring scenarios when multiple instances of the same add-in are
      working against the same document. Because each add-in is working against an in-memory copy of the settings loaded
      from the document at the time the user opened it, the settings values used by each user can get out of sync. This
      can happen whenever an instance of the add-in calls the Settings.saveAsync method to persist all of that user's
      settings to the document. Calling the refreshAsync method from the event handler for the settingsChanged event of
      the add-in will refresh the settings values for all users.


      The refreshAsync method can be called from add-ins created for Excel, but since it doesn't support coauthoring
      there is no reason to do so.


      In the callback function passed to the refreshAsync method, you can use the properties of the AsyncResult object
      to return the following information.


      <table> <tr> <th>Property</th> <th>Use to...</th> </tr> <tr> <td>AsyncResult.value</td> <td>Access a Settings
      object with the refreshed values.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AsyncResult.status</td> <td>Determine the success or failure
      of the operation.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AsyncResult.error</td> <td>Access an Error object that provides error
      information if the operation failed.</td> </tr> <tr> <td>AsyncResult.asyncContext</td> <td>A user-defined item of
      any type that is returned in the AsyncResult object without being altered.</td> </tr> </table>

      Important: Be aware that the Settings.remove method affects only the in-memory copy of the settings property bag.
      To persist the removal of the specified setting in the document, at some point after calling the Settings.remove
      method and before the add-in is closed, you must call the Settings.saveAsync method.

      null is a valid value for a setting. Therefore, assigning null to the setting will not remove it from the settings
      property bag.

      Any settings previously saved by an add-in are loaded when it is initialized, so during the lifetime of the
      session you can just use the set and get methods to work with the in-memory copy of the settings property bag.
      When you want to persist the settings so that they are available the next time the add-in is used, use the
      saveAsync method.


      Note: The saveAsync method persists the in-memory settings property bag into the document file; however, the
      changes to the document file itself are saved only when the user (or AutoRecover setting) saves the document to
      the file system. The refreshAsync method is only useful in coauthoring scenarios (which are only supported in
      Word) when other instances of the same add-in might change the settings and those changes should be made available
      to all instances.
