    summary: >-
      Gets the node which was just deleted (replaced) from the CustomXmlPart object.


      Note that this node may have children, if a subtree is being removed from the document. Also, this node will be a
      "disconnected" node in that you can query down from the node, but you cannot query up the tree - the node appears
      to exist alone.
