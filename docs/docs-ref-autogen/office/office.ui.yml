      your Office Add-ins.

    summary: Closes the UI container where the JavaScript is executing.
    remarks: >-
      The behavior of this method is specified by the following:


      - Called from a UI-less command button: No effect. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will remain open.


      - Called from a taskpane: The taskpane will close. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will also close. If the
      taskpane supports pinning and was pinned by the user, it will be un-pinned.


      - Called from a module extension: No effect.

    summary: Displays a dialog to show or collect information from the user or to facilitate Web navigation.
    remarks: >-
      Hosts: Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint


      Requirement sets: DialogAPI, Mailbox 1.4


      The initial page must be on the same domain as the parent page (the startAddress parameter). After the initial
      page loads, you can go to other domains.


      Any page calling `office.context.ui.messageParent` must also be on the same domain as the parent page.


      **Design considerations**:


      The following design considerations apply to dialog boxes:


      - An Office Add-in can have only one dialog box open at any time.


      - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.


      - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.


      - Dialog boxes appear on top of the host application and in the order in which they were created.


      Use a dialog box to:


      - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.


      - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaspane or ExecuteAction command.


      - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.


      Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.


      For a design pattern that you can use to create a dialog box, see [Client
      Dialog](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Office-Add-in-UX-Design-Patterns/blob/master/Patterns/Client_Dialog.md) in
      the Office Add-in UX Design Patterns repository on GitHub.


      **displayDialogAsync Errors**:


      &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Code number&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Meaning&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12004&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The domain of the URL passed to displayDialogAsync is not trusted. The domain
      must be either the same domain as the host page (including protocol and port number), or it must be registered in
      the &lt;AppDomains&gt; section of the add-in manifest.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;12005&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;The URL passed to displayDialogAsync uses the HTTP protocol. HTTPS is
      required. (In some versions of Office, the error message returned with 12005 is the same one returned for
      12004.)&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;12007&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;A dialog box is already opened from
      the task pane. A task pane add-in can only have one dialog box open at a time.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt;
      &lt;/table&gt;


      In the callback function passed to the displayDialogAsync method, you can use the properties of the AsyncResult
      object to return the following information.


      &lt;table&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;th&gt;Property&lt;/th&gt; &lt;th&gt;Use to&lt;/th&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AsyncResult.value&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Access the Dialog object.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AsyncResult.status&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Determine the success or failure of the operation.&lt;/td&gt;
      &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt; &lt;td&gt;AsyncResult.error&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Access an Error object that provides error
      information if the operation failed.&lt;td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;tr&gt;
      &lt;td&gt;AsyncResult.asyncContext&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt;Access your user-defined object or value, if you passed
      one as the asyncContext parameter.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;/tr&gt; &lt;/table&gt;
