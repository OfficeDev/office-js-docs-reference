      your Office Add-ins.

  - uid: office.Office.UI.closeContainer
    summary: Closes the UI container where the JavaScript is executing.
    remarks: >-
      The behavior of this method is specified by the following:


      - Called from a UI-less command button: No effect. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will remain open.


      - Called from a taskpane: The taskpane will close. Any dialog opened by displayDialogAsync will also close. If the
      taskpane supports pinning and was pinned by the user, it will be un-pinned.


      - Called from a module extension: No effect.

  - uid: office.Office.UI.displayDialogAsync
    summary: Displays a dialog to show or collect information from the user or to facilitate Web navigation.
    remarks: >-
      Hosts: Word, Excel, Outlook, PowerPoint


      Requirement sets: DialogAPI, Mailbox 1.4


      The initial page must be on the same domain as the parent page (the startAddress parameter). After the initial
      page loads, you can go to other domains.


      Any page calling office.context.ui.messageParent must also be on the same domain as the parent page.


      The following design considerations apply to dialog boxes:


      - An Office Add-in can have only one dialog box open at any time.


      - Every dialog box can be moved and resized by the user.


      - Every dialog box is centered on the screen when opened.


      - Dialog boxes appear on top of the host application and in the order in which they were created.


      Use a dialog box to:


      - Display authentication pages to collect user credentials.


      - Display an error/progress/input screen from a ShowTaspane or ExecuteAction command.


      - Temporarily increase the surface area that a user has available to complete a task.


      Do not use a dialog box to interact with a document. Use a task pane instead.
