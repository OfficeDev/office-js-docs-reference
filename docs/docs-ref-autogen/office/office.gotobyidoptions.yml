      The behavior caused by the [ options.selectionMode](xref:office.Office.SelectionMode) option varies by host:


      In Excel: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects all content in the binding, or named item.
      `Office.SelectionMode.None` for text bindings, selects the cell; for matrix bindings, table bindings, and named
      items, selects the first data cell (not first cell in header row for tables).


      In PowerPoint: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects the slide title or first textbox on the slide.
      `Office.SelectionMode.None` doesn't select anything.


      In Word: `Office.SelectionMode.Selected` selects all content in the binding. `Office.SelectionMode.None` for text
      bindings, moves the cursor to the beginning of the text; for matrix bindings and table bindings, selects the first
      data cell (not first cell in header row for tables).
