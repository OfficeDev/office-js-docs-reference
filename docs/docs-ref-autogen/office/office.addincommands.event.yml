      Indicates that the add-in has completed processing that was triggered by an add-in command button or event
      handler.


      This method must be called at the end of a function which was invoked by an add-in command defined with an Action
      element with an xsi:type attribute set to ExecuteFunction. Calling this method signals the host client that the
      function is complete and that it can clean up any state involved with invoking the function. For example, if the
      user closes Outlook before this method is called, Outlook will warn that a function is still executing.


      This method must be called in an event handler added via Office.context.mailbox.addHandlerAsync after completing
      processing of the event.
