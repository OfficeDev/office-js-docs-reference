      To add an event handler for the settingsChanged event, use the addHandlerAsync method of the
      [Office.Settings](xref:office.Office.Settings) object.


      The settingsChanged event fires only when your add-in's script calls the Settings.saveAsync method to persist the
      in-memory copy of the settings into the document file. The settingsChanged event is not triggered when the
      Settings.set or Settings.remove methods are called.


      The settingsChanged event was designed to let you to handle potential conflicts when two or more users are
      attempting to save settings at the same time when your add-in is used in a shared (co-authored) document.


      **Important**: Your add-in's code can register a handler for the settingsChanged event when the add-in is running
      with any Excel client, but the event will fire only when the add-in is loaded with a spreadsheet that is opened in
      Excel Online, and more than one user is editing the spreadsheet (co-authoring). Therefore, effectively the
      settingsChanged event is supported only in Excel Online in co-authoring scenarios.
