      Allows Office to get an access token silently or through interactive consent, if one is required. Default value is
      `false`<!-- -->. If set to `false`<!-- -->, Office will silently try to get an access token. If it fails to do so,
      Office will return a descriptive error. If set to `true`<!-- -->, Office will show an interactive consent UI after
      it fails to silently get an access token. The prompt will only allow consent to the AAD profile scope, not to any
      Microsoft Graph scopes.

    summary: >-
      Causes Office to prompt the user to provide the additional factor when the tenancy being targeted by Microsoft
      Graph requires multifactor authentication. The string value identifies the type of additional factor that is
      required. In most cases, you won't know at development time whether the user's tenant requires an additional
      factor or what the string should be. So this option would be used in a "second try" call of `getAccessToken` after
      Microsoft Graph has sent an error requesting the additional factor and containing the string that should be used
      with the `authChallenge` option.

      Causes Office to display the add-in consent experience. Useful if the add-in's Azure permissions have changed or

    summary: >-
      Causes Office to return a descriptive error when the add-in wants to access Microsoft Graph and the user/admin has
      not granted consent to Graph scopes. Default value is `false`<!-- -->. Office only supports consent to Graph
      scopes when the add-in has been deployed by a tenant admin. This information will not be available during
      development. Setting this option to `true` will cause Office to inform your add-in beforehand (by returning a
      descriptive error) if Graph access will fail.
