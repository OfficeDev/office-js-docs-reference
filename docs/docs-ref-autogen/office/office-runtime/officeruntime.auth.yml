  The methods in this interface are equivalent to those in the `Office.auth` interface. If new authentication types are
  added in the future, they will only be added to the `Office.auth` interface. For simplicity, the code examples
  throughout the documentation use `Office.auth`<!-- -->.

    summary: >-
      Calls the Azure Active Directory V 2.0 endpoint to get an access token to your add-in's web application. Enables
      add-ins to identify users. Server-side code can use this token to access Microsoft Graph for the add-in's web
      application by using the ["on behalf of" OAuth
      flow](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/active-directory/develop/active-directory-v2-protocols-oauth-on-behalf-of)<!--
      -->. This API requires a single sign-on configuration that bridges the add-in to an Azure application. Office
      users sign-in with Organizational Accounts and Microsoft Accounts. Microsoft Azure returns tokens intended for
      both user account types to access resources in the Microsoft Graph.


      **Important**: In Outlook, this API is not supported if the add-in is loaded in an Outlook.com or Gmail mailbox.
