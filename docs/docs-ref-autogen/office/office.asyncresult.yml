      When the function you pass to the \`callback\` parameter of an "Async" method executes, it receives an AsyncResult
      object that you can access from the \`callback\` function's only parameter.

      Gets the user-defined item passed to the optional \`asyncContext\` parameter of the invoked method in the same
      state as it was passed in. This the user-defined item (which can be of any JavaScript type: String, Number,
      Boolean, Object, Array, Null, or Undefined) passed to the optional \`asyncContext\` parameter of the invoked
      method. Returns Undefined, if you didn't pass anything to the asyncContext parameter.

      You access the AsyncResult object in the function passed as the argument to the callback parameter of an "Async"
      method, such as the \`getSelectedDataAsync\` and \`setSelectedDataAsync\` methods of the Document object.


      Note: What the value property returns for a particular "Async" method varies depending on the purpose and context
      of that method. To determine what is returned by the value property for an "Async" method, refer to the "Callback
      value" section of the method's topic. For a complete listing of the "Async" methods, see the Remarks section of
      the AsyncResult object topic.
