summary: >-
  Represents a suggested meeting found in an item. Read mode only.


  The list of meetings suggested in an email message is returned in the `meetingSuggestions` property of the `Entities`
  object that is returned when the `getEntities` or `getEntitiesByType` method is called on the active item.


  The start and end values are string representations of a `Date` object that contains the date and time at which the
  suggested meeting is to begin and end. The values are in the default time zone specified for the current user.

  **Important**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins will be retired in Q2 of 2024. The work to retire this
  feature will start in May and continue until the end of June. After June, contextual add-ins will no longer be able to
  detect entities in mail items to perform tasks on them. The following APIs will also be retired.


  - `Office.context.mailbox.item.getEntities` - `Office.context.mailbox.item.getEntitiesByType` -
  `Office.context.mailbox.item.getFilteredEntitiesByName` - `Office.context.mailbox.item.getSelectedEntities`


  To help minimize potential disruptions, the following will still be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins
  are retired.


  - An alternative implementation of the **Join Meeting** button, which is activated by online meeting add-ins, is
  being developed. Once support for entity-based contextual add-ins ends, online meeting add-ins will automatically
  transition to the alternative implementation to activate the **Join Meeting** button.


  - Regular expression rules will continue to be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins are retired. We
  recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution. For guidance on
  how to implement these rules, see [Use regular expression activation rules to show an Outlook
  add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/use-regular-expressions-to-show-an-outlook-add-in)<!--
  -->.

  add-ins](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-entity-based-contextual-outlook-add-ins)<!--

  #### Examples


  ```TypeScript

  const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;

  // Get an array of strings that represent meeting suggestions in the current item's body.

  const meetingSuggestions = item.getEntitiesByType(Office.MailboxEnums.EntityType.MeetingSuggestion);

  console.log("There are " + meetingSuggestions.length + " meeting suggestions.")

  meetingSuggestions.forEach(function (meetingSuggestion) {
      console.log("Subject: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.subject));
      console.log("Attendees: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.attendees));
      console.log("Location: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.location));
      console.log("Start: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.start));
      console.log("End: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.end));
      console.log("Meeting: " + JSON.stringify(meetingSuggestion.meetingString));
  });
