      The removeAttachmentAsync method removes the attachment with the specified identifier from the item. As a best
      practice, you should use the attachment identifier to remove an attachment only if the same mail app has added
      that attachment in the same session. In Outlook on the web and mobile devices, the attachment identifier is valid
      only within the same session. A session is over when the user closes the app, or if the user starts composing an

      When invoked, this method saves the current message as a draft and returns the item id via the callback method. In
      Outlook on the web or Outlook in online mode, the item is saved to the server. In Outlook in cached mode, the item
      is saved to the local cache.


      Since appointments have no draft state, if saveAsync is called on an appointment in compose mode, the item will be
      saved as a normal appointment on the user's calendar. For new appointments that have not been saved before, no
      invitation will be sent. Saving an existing appointment will send an update to added or removed attendees.


      **Note**: If your add-in calls saveAsync on an item in compose mode in order to get an itemId to use with EWS or
      the REST API, be aware that when Outlook is in cached mode, it may take some time before the item is actually
      synced to the server. Until the item is synced, using the itemId will return an error.


      **Note**: The following clients have different behavior for saveAsync on appointments in compose mode:


      - Outlook on Mac does not support saving a meeting. The saveAsync method fails when called from a meeting in
      compose mode. See [Cannot save a meeting as a draft in Outlook for Mac by using Office JS
      API](https://support.microsoft.com/help/4505745) for a workaround.
