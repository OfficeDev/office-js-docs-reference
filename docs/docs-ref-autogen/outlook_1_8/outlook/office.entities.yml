### YamlMime:TSType
name: Office.Entities
uid: 'outlook!Office.Entities:interface'
package: outlook!
fullName: Office.Entities
summary: >-
  Represents a collection of entities found in an email message or appointment.
  Read mode only.


  The `Entities` object is a container for the entity arrays returned by the
  `getEntities` and `getEntitiesByType` methods when the item (either an email
  message or an appointment) contains one or more entities that have been found
  by the server. You can use these entities in your code to provide additional
  context information to the viewer, such as a map to an address found in the
  item, or to open a dialer for a phone number found in the item.


  If no entities of the type specified in the property are present in the item,
  the property associated with that entity is null. For example, if a message
  contains a street address and a phone number, the addresses property and
  phoneNumbers property would contain information, and the other properties
  would be null.


  To be recognized as an address, the string must contain a United States postal
  address that has at least a subset of the elements of a street number, street
  name, city, state, and zip code.


  To be recognized as a phone number, the string must contain a North American
  phone number format.


  Entity recognition relies on natural language recognition that is based on
  machine learning of large amounts of data. The recognition of an entity is
  non-deterministic and success sometimes relies on the particular context in
  the item.


  When the property arrays are returned by the `getEntitiesByType` method, only
  the property for the specified entity contains data; all other properties are
  null.
