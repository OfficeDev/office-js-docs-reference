summary: >-
  Represents the details about a contact (similar to what's on a physical contact or business card) extracted from the
  item's body. Read mode only.


  The list of contacts extracted from the body of an email message or appointment is returned in the `contacts` property
  of the [Entities](xref:outlook!Office.Entities:interface) object returned by the `getEntities` or `getEntitiesByType`
  method of the current item.

  **Important**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins will be retired in Q2 of 2024. Once retired, contextual
  add-ins will no longer be able to detect entities in mail items to perform tasks on them. To help minimize potential
  disruptions, the following will still be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins are retired.


  - An alternative implementation of the **Join Meeting** button, which is activated by online meeting add-ins, is
  being developed. Once support for entity-based contextual add-ins ends, online meeting add-ins will automatically
  transition to the alternative implementation to activate the **Join Meeting** button.


  - Regular expression rules will continue to be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins are retired. We
  recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution. For guidance on
  how to implement these rules, see [Use regular expression activation rules to show an Outlook
  add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/use-regular-expressions-to-show-an-outlook-add-in)<!--
  -->.

  add-ins](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/retirement-of-entity-based-contextual-outlook-add-ins)<!--

  #### Examples


  ```TypeScript

  const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;

  // Get an array of strings that represent contacts in the current item's body.

  const contacts = item.getEntitiesByType(Office.MailboxEnums.EntityType.Contact);

  console.log("There are " + contacts.length + " contacts.")

  contacts.forEach(function (contact) {
      console.log("Person name: " + JSON.stringify(contact.personName));
      console.log("Business name: " + JSON.stringify(contact.businessName));
      console.log("Addresses: " + JSON.stringify(contact.addresses));
      console.log("Phone numbers: " + JSON.stringify(contact.phoneNumbers));
      console.log("Email addresses: " + JSON.stringify(contact.emailAddresses));
      console.log("Urls: " + JSON.stringify(contact.urls));
  });
