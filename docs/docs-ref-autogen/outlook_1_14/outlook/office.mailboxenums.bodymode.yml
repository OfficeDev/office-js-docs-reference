      The body mode depends on the user's current setting for message
      organization (that is, messages are organized as conversations or
      individual messages). If messages are organized by conversation, it
      specifies only the current body of the reply. Conversely, if messages are
      organized as individual messages, it specifies the entire body of a
      message, including previous messages from the same conversation thread.
