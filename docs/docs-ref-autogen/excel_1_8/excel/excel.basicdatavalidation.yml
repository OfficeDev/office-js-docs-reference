      Specifies the right-hand operand when the operator property is set to a binary operator such as GreaterThan (the
      left-hand operand is the value the user tries to enter in the cell). With the ternary operators Between and
      NotBetween, specifies the lower bound operand. For example, setting formula1 to 10 and operator to GreaterThan
      means that valid data for the range must be greater than 10. When setting the value, it can be passed in as a
      number, a range object, or a string formula (where the string is either a stringified number, a cell reference
      like "=A1", or a formula like "=MIN(A1, B1)"). When retrieving the value, it will always be returned as a string
      formula, for example: "=10", "=A1", "=SUM(A1:B5)", etc.
