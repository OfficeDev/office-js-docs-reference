  Represents a suggested meeting found in an item. Read mode only.


  The list of meetings suggested in an email message is returned in the `meetingSuggestions` property of the `Entities`
  object that's returned when the `getEntities` or `getEntitiesByType` method is called on the active item.


  The start and end values are string representations of a `Date` object that contains the date and time at which the
  suggested meeting is to begin and end. The values are in the default time zone specified for the current user.


  **Warning**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins are now retired. However, regular expression rules are still
  supported. We recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution.
  For guidance on how to implement these rules, see [Contextual Outlook
