      Setting represents a key-value pair of a setting persisted to the document (per file per add-in). These custom
      key-value pair can be used to store state or lifecycle information needed by the content or task-pane add-in. Note
      that settings are persisted in the document and hence it is not a place to store any sensitive or protected
      information such as user information and password.

    remarks: >-
      In addition to this signature, this method has the following signatures:


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; }): Excel.Setting` - Where option.select is a comma-delimited
      string that specifies the properties to load, and options.expand is a comma-delimited string that specifies the
      navigation properties to load.


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; top?: number; skip?: number }): Excel.Setting` - Only available
      on collection types. It is similar to the preceding signature. Option.top specifies the maximum number of
      collection items that can be included in the result. Option.skip specifies the number of items that are to be
      skipped and not included in the result. If option.top is specified, the result set will start after skipping the
      specified number of items.
