      Sets the subject of an appointment or message.


      The setAsync method starts an asynchronous call to the Exchange server to set the subject of an appointment or
      message. Setting the subject overwrites the current subject, but leaves any prefixes, such as "Fwd:" or "Re:" in
      place.
