      - The `contentId` property is only supported in Outlook on the web and

      - Starting November 15, 2025, changes to how inline images are represented
      in the HTML body of Outlook emails in Outlook on the web and the new
      Outlook on Windows will begin rolling out to production users. Previously,
      the attachment ID of the image appeared in the `src` attribute of the
      applicable `<img>` element. After the change, the image will be
      represented by a content ID (`cid`<!-- -->) in the `src` attribute
      instead. As a result, you'll need to update your add-in's parsing logic if
      you parse the attachment ID from the HTML editor or get the Base64 value
      of the image from the URL in the `src` attribute. For more information,
      see [Changes to inline image representation in Outlook on the web and new
      Outlook for
      Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook)<!--
