    remarks: >-
      In addition to this signature, this method has the following signatures:


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; }): OneNote.InkWord` - Where option.select is a comma-delimited
      string that specifies the properties to load, and options.expand is a comma-delimited string that specifies the
      navigation properties to load.


      `load(option?: { select?: string; expand?: string; top?: number; skip?: number }): OneNote.InkWord` - Only
      available on collection types. It is similar to the preceding signature. Option.top specifies the maximum number
      of collection items that can be included in the result. Option.skip specifies the number of items that are to be
      skipped and not included in the result. If option.top is specified, the result set will start after skipping the
      specified number of items.

      Track the object for automatic adjustment based on surrounding changes in the document. This call is a shorthand
      for context.trackedObjects.add(thisObject). If you are using this object across ".sync" calls and outside the
      sequential execution of a ".run" batch, and get an "InvalidObjectPath" error when setting a property or invoking a
      method on the object, you needed to have added the object to the tracked object collection when the object was
      first created.

      Release the memory associated with this object, if it has previously been tracked. This call is shorthand for
      context.trackedObjects.remove(thisObject). Having many tracked objects slows down the host application, so please
      remember to free any objects you add, once you're done using them. You will need to call "context.sync()" before
      the memory release takes effect.
