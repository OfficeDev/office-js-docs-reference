    package: outlook!

  - name: ExternalUser
    uid: outlook!Office.MailboxEnums.RecipientType.ExternalUser:member
    package: outlook!
    summary: >-
      Specifies the recipient is an SMTP email address that isn't on the
      Exchange server. It also refers to a recipient added from a personal
      Outlook address book.


      **Important**: In Outlook on the web, on Windows
      ([new](https://support.microsoft.com/office/656bb8d9-5a60-49b2-a98b-ba7822bc7627)
      and classic (starting with Version 2210, Build 15813.20002)), and on Mac,
      Global Address Book (GAL) recipients saved to a personal address book
      return the `ExternalUser` value, even if their SMTP email address appears
      on the Exchange server. Recipients return a `User` value only if they're
      directly added or resolved against the GAL.
    value: '"externalUser"'
  - name: Other
    uid: outlook!Office.MailboxEnums.RecipientType.Other:member
    package: outlook!
    summary: >-
      Specifies the recipient isn't one of the other recipient types. It also
      refers to a recipient that isn't resolved against the Exchange address
      book, and is therefore treated as an external SMTP address.


      **Important**: In Outlook on Android and on iOS, Global Address Book
      (GAL) recipients saved to a personal address book return the `Other`
      value, even if their SMTP email address appears on the Exchange server.
      Recipients return a `User` value only if they're directly added or
      resolved against the GAL.
    value: '"other"'
