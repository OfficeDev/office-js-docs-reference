    summary: >-
      Specifies the slides from the source presentation that will be inserted
      into the current presentation. These slides are represented by their IDs
      which can be retrieved from a `Slide` object. The order of these slides is
      preserved during the insertion. If any of the source slides are not found,
      or if the IDs are invalid, the operation throws a `SlideNotFound`
      exception and no slides will be inserted. All of the source slides will be
      inserted when `sourceSlideIds` is not provided (this is the default
      behavior).

    summary: >-
      Specifies where in the presentation the new slides will be inserted. The
      new slides will be inserted after the slide with the given slide ID. If
      `targetSlideId` is not provided, the slides will be inserted at the
      beginning of the presentation. If `targetSlideId` is invalid or if it is
      pointing to a non-existing slide, the operation throws a `SlideNotFound`
      exception and no slides will be inserted.
