  **Important**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins will be retired in Q2 of 2024. Once retired, contextual
  add-ins will no longer be able to detect entities in mail items to perform tasks on them. To help minimize potential
  disruptions, the following will still be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins are retired.


  - An alternative implementation of the **Join Meeting** button, which is activated by online meeting add-ins, is
  being developed. Once support for entity-based contextual add-ins ends, online meeting add-ins will automatically
  transition to the alternative implementation to activate the **Join Meeting** button.


  - Regular expression rules will continue to be supported after entity-based contextual add-ins are retired. We
  recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution. For guidance on
  how to implement these rules, see [Use regular expression activation rules to show an Outlook
  add-in](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/use-regular-expressions-to-show-an-outlook-add-in)<!--
  -->.
