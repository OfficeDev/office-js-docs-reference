      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the

      contains either the attachment identifier or a code that indicates any error that occurred while attaching the

      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook Web App, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to items
      other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.
