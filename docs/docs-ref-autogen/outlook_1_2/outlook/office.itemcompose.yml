      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the

      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook on the web, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to
      items other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.

      Asynchronously inserts data into the body or subject of a message.


      The setSelectedDataAsync method inserts the specified string at the cursor location in the subject or body of the
      item, or, if text is selected in the editor, it replaces the selected text. If the cursor is not in the body or
      subject field, an error is returned. After insertion, the cursor is placed at the end of the inserted content.
