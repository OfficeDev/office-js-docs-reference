      The `end` property is a [Time](xref:outlook!Office.Time:interface) object

      can use the `convertToLocalClientTime` method to convert the `end`

      **Important**: In the Windows client, you can't use this property to
      update the end of a recurrence.

      devices](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/outlook-mobile-apis)<!--
      -->.


      - Bitmap (BMP) images aren't supported if they're added as inline
      attachments.


      - In recent builds of classic Outlook on Windows, a bug was introduced
      that incorrectly appends an `Authorization: Bearer` header to this action
      (whether using this API or the Outlook UI). To work around this issue, use
      the `addFileAttachmentFromBase64` API introduced with requirement set 1.8.


      - The URI of the file to be attached must support caching in production.
      The server hosting the image shouldn't return a `Cache-Control` header
      that specifies `no-cache`<!-- -->, `no-store`<!-- -->, or similar options
      in the HTTP response. However, when you're developing the add-in and
      making changes to files, caching can prevent you from seeing your changes.
      We recommend using `Cache-Control` headers during development.


      - You can use the same URI with the `removeAttachmentAsync` method to
      remove the attachment in the same session.


      **Errors**:


      - `AttachmentSizeExceeded`<!-- -->: The attachment is larger than allowed.
