      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook Web App, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to items
      other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.

      If there is no selection but the cursor is in the body or subject, the method returns null for the selected data.
      If a field other than the body or subject is selected, the method returns the InvalidSelection error.


      To access the selected data from the callback method, call asyncResult.value.data. To access the source property
      that the selection comes from, call asyncResult.value.sourceProperty, which will be either body or subject.
