  **Important**: The Outlook REST v2.0 and beta endpoints are now
  deprecated. However, privately released and AppSource-hosted add-ins are able
  to use the REST service until extended support ends for Outlook 2019 on
  October 14, 2025. Traffic from these add-ins is automatically identified for
  exemption. This exemption also applies to new add-ins developed after March
  31, 2024. Although add-ins are able to use the REST service until 2025, we
  highly encourage you to migrate your add-ins to use [Microsoft
  Graph](https://learn.microsoft.com/outlook/rest#outlook-rest-api-via-microsoft-graph)<!--
  -->. For guidance, see [Compare Microsoft Graph and Outlook REST API
  endpoints](https://learn.microsoft.com/outlook/rest/compare-graph)<!-- -->.
