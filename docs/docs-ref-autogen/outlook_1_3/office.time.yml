      method.

      Sets the start or end time of an appointment.


      If the setAsync method is called on the start property, the end property will be adjusted to maintain the duration
      of the appointment as previously set. If the setAsync method is called on the end property, the duration of the
      appointment will be extended to the new end time.


      The time must be in UTC; you can get the correct UTC time by using the convertToUtcClientTime method.
