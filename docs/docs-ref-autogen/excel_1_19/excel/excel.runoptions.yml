      Determines whether Excel will delay the batch request until the user exits
      cell edit mode.


      When `false`<!-- -->, if the user is in cell edit when the batch request
      is processed by the host, the batch automatically fails. When `true`<!--
      -->, the batch request is executed immediately if the user is not in cell
      edit mode, but if the user is in cell edit mode then the batch request is
      delayed until the user exits cell edit mode. The default behavior with no
      `delayForCellEdit` property specified is equivalent to when it is
      `false`<!-- -->.
