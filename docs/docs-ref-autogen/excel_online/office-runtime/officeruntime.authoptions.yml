      Allows Office to get an access token silectly or through interactive consent, if one is required. If set to false,
      Office will silently try to get an access token. If it fails to do so, Office will return a descriptive error. If
      set to true, Office will show an interactive consent UI after it fails to silently get an access token. The prompt
      will only allow consent to the AAD profile scope, not to any Microsoft Graph scopes.

    summary: >-
      Causes Office to prompt the user to provide the additional factor when the tenancy being targeted by Microsoft
      Graph requires multifactor authentication. The string value identifies the type of additional factor that is
      required. In most cases, you won't know at development time whether the user's tenant requires an additional
      factor or what the string should be. So this option would be used in a "second try" call of getAccessToken after
      Microsoft Graph has sent an error requesting the additional factor and containing the string that should be used
      with the authChallenge option.

    summary: >-
      Causes Office to return descriptive error when the add-in wants to access MS Graph and the user/admin has not
      granted consent to MS Graph scopes. Office only supports consent to graph scopes when the add-in has been deployed
      by a tenant admin. This information will not be available during development. Setting this option to true will
      allow Office to inform your add-in beforehand if MS graph access will fail by returning back a descriptive error.
