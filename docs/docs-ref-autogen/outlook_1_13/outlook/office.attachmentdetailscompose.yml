      - The `contentId` property is only supported in Outlook on the web, the
      new Outlook on Windows, and classic Outlook on Windows (preview). To
      preview the `contentId` property in classic Outlook on Windows, your
      Outlook client must run Version 2510 (Build 19312.20000) or later and must
      be on the Beta Channel. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Insider

      - Changes to how inline images are represented in the HTML body of Outlook
      emails in Outlook on the web and the new Outlook on Windows released on
      November 15, 2025. Previously, the attachment ID of the image appeared in
      the `src` attribute of the applicable `<img>` element. Now, the image is
      represented by a content ID (`cid`<!-- -->) in the `src` attribute
      instead. If you parse the attachment ID from the HTML editor or get the
      Base64-encoded value of the image from the URL in the `src` attribute, you
      must update your add-in's parsing logic. For more information, see

      Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook)<!--
