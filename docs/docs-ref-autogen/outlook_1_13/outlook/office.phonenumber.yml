  Represents a phone number identified in an item. Read mode only.


  An array of `PhoneNumber` objects containing the phone numbers found in an email message is returned in the
  `phoneNumbers` property of the `Entities` object that's returned when you call the `getEntities` method on the
  selected item.


  **Warning**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins are now retired. However, regular expression rules are still
  supported. We recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution.

  const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;

  // Get an array of strings that represent phone numbers in the current item's body.

  const phoneNumbers = item.getEntitiesByType(Office.MailboxEnums.EntityType.PhoneNumber);

  console.log("There are " + phoneNumbers.length + " phone numbers.")

  phoneNumbers.forEach(function (phoneNumber) {
      console.log("Phone number: " + JSON.stringify(phoneNumber.phoneString));
      console.log("Type: " + JSON.stringify(phoneNumber.type));
