summary: >-
  Represents a suggested task identified in an item. Read mode only.


  The list of tasks suggested in an email message is returned in the `taskSuggestions` property of the
  [Entities](xref:outlook!Office.Entities:interface) object that's returned when the `getEntities` or
  `getEntitiesByType` method is called on the active item.


  **Warning**: Entity-based contextual Outlook add-ins are now retired. However, regular expression rules are still
  supported. We recommend updating your contextual add-in to use regular expression rules as an alternative solution.
  For guidance on how to implement these rules, see [Contextual Outlook
  add-ins](https://learn.microsoft.com/office/dev/add-ins/outlook/contextual-outlook-add-ins)<!-- -->.

  const item = Office.context.mailbox.item;

  // Get an array of strings that represent task suggestions in the current item's body.

  const taskSuggestions = item.getEntitiesByType(Office.MailboxEnums.EntityType.TaskSuggestion);

  console.log("There are " + taskSuggestions.length + " task suggestions.")

  taskSuggestions.forEach(function (taskSuggestion) {
      console.log("Assignees: " + JSON.stringify(taskSuggestion.assignees));
      console.log("Task: " + JSON.stringify(taskSuggestion.taskString));
  });
