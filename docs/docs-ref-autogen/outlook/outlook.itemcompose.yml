      Adds an Exchange item, such as a message, as an attachment to the message or appointment.


      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the
      compose form. If you specify a callback method, the method is called with one parameter,Office.AsyncResult, which
      contains either the attachment identifier or a code that indicates any error that occurred while attaching the
      item. You can use the options parameter to pass state information to the callback method, if needed.


      You can subsequently use the identifier with the removeAttachmentAsync method to remove the attachment in the same
      session.


      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook Web App, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to items
      other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.

      The behaviors of the close method depends on the current state of the item being composed. If the item has unsaved

      In the Outlook desktop client, if the message is an inline reply, the close method has no effect.


      Note: In Outlook on the web, if the item is an appointment and it has previously been saved using saveAsync, the
      user is prompted to save, discard, or cancel even if no changes have occurred since the item was last saved.

      Note: If your add-in calls saveAsync on an item in compose mode in order to get an itemId to use with EWS or the
      REST API, be aware that when Outlook is in cached mode, it may take some time before the item is actually synced
      to the server. Until the item is synced, using the itemId will return an error.


      Note: The following clients have different behavior for saveAsync on appointments in compose mode:


      - Mac Outlook does not support saveAsync on a meeting in compose mode. Calling saveAsync on a meeting in Mac
      Outlook will return an error.


      - Outlook on the web always sends an invitation or update when saveAsync is called on an appointment in compose
      mode.
