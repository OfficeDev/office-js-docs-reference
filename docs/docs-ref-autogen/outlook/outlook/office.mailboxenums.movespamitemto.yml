  **Important**: This enum can only be used to assign values to the
  [moveItemTo](https://learn.microsoft.com/javascript/api/office/office.addincommands.eventcompletedoptions?view=outlook-js-preview&preserve-view=true#office-office-addincommands-eventcompletedoptions-moveitemto-member)

  #### Examples


  ```TypeScript

  // The following example handles a SpamReporting event to process a reported spam or phishing message.

  function onSpamReport(event) {
      // Gets the Base64-encoded EML format of a reported message.
      Office.context.mailbox.item.getAsFileAsync({ asyncContext: event }, (asyncResult) => {
          if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
              console.log(`Error encountered during message processing: ${asyncResult.error.message}`);
              return;
          }

          // Run additional processing operations here.

          /**
          * Signals that the spam-reporting event has completed processing.
          * It then moves the reported message to a custom mailbox folder named "Reported Messages"
          * and shows a post-processing dialog to the user.
          * If an error occurs while the message is being processed, the `onErrorDeleteItem`
          * property determines whether the message will be deleted.
          */
          const event = asyncResult.asyncContext;
          event.completed({
              moveItemTo: Office.MailboxEnums.MoveSpamItemTo.CustomFolder,
