      **Important**:


      - If multiple add-ins that implement `setAsync` run simultaneously, the
      content set by the last add-in that completes the `setAsync` operation is
      displayed in the subject field.


      - The content set by the `setAsync` method is only displayed while the
      user is viewing the item. It isn't cached in Outlook and doesn't sync with
      other Outlook clients.


      - If you save a message after calling `setAsync`<!-- -->, the original
      subject appears in the saved item.


      - The `setAsync` method isn't supported on multiple selected messages.
