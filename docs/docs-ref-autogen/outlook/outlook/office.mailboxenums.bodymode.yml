      The body mode depends on the user's current setting for message organization (that is, messages are organized as
      conversations or individual messages). If messages are organized by conversation, it specifies only the current
      body of the reply. Conversely, if messages are organized as individual messages, it specifies the entire body of a
      message, including previous messages from the same conversation thread.
    value: '1'
