      Gets or sets the recurrence pattern of an appointment. Gets the recurrence pattern of a meeting request. Read and
      compose modes for appointment items. Read mode for meeting request items.


      The recurrence property returns a recurrence object for recurring appointments or meetings requests if an item is
      a series or an instance in a series. null is returned for single appointments and meeting requests of single
      appointments. undefined is returned for messages that are not meeting requests.


      Note: Meeting requests have an itemClass value of IPM.Schedule.Meeting.Request.


      Note: If the recurrence object is null, this indicates that the object is a single appointment or a meeting
      request of a single appointment and NOT a part of a series.

  - uid: outlook.Office.Appointment.seriesId
    summary: >-
      Gets the id of the series that an instance belongs to.


      In OWA and Outlook, the seriesId returns the Exchange Web Services (EWS) ID of the parent (series) item that this
      item belongs to. However, in iOS and Android, the seriesId returns the REST ID of the parent item.


      Note: The identifier returned by the seriesId property is the same as the Exchange Web Services item identifier.
      The seriesId property is not identical to the Outlook IDs used by the Outlook REST API. Before making REST API
      calls using this value, it should be converted using Office.context.mailbox.convertToRestId. For more details, see
      \[Use the Outlook REST APIs from an Outlook add-in\](https://docs.microsoft.com/outlook/add-ins/use-rest-api).


      The seriesId property returns null for items that do not have parent items such as single appointments, series
      items, or meeting requests and returns undefined for any other items that are not meeting requests.
