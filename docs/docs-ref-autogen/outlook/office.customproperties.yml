    summary: >-
      The CustomProperties object represents custom properties that are specific to a particular item and specific to a
      mail add-in for Outlook. For example, there might be a need for a mail add-in to save some data that is specific
      to the current email message that activated the add-in. If the user revisits the same message in the future and
      activates the mail add-in again, the add-in will be able to retrieve the data that had been saved as custom
      properties.


      Because Outlook for Mac doesn't cache custom properties, if the user's network goes down, mail add-ins cannot
      access their custom properties.

    summary: >-
      Saves item-specific custom properties to the server.


      You must call the saveAsync method to persist any changes made with the set method or the remove method of the
      CustomProperties object. The saving action is asynchronous.


      It's a good practice to have your callback function check for and handle errors from saveAsync. In particular, a
      read add-in can be activated while the user is in a connected state in a read form, and subsequently the user
      becomes disconnected. If the add-in calls saveAsync while in the disconnected state, saveAsync would return an
      error. Your callback method should handle this error accordingly.

    summary: >-
      Sets the specified property to the specified value.


      The set method sets the specified property to the specified value. You must use the saveAsync method to save the
      property to the server.


      The set method creates a new property if the specified property does not already exist; otherwise, the existing
      value is replaced with the new value. The value parameter can be of any type; however, it is always passed to the
      server as a string.
