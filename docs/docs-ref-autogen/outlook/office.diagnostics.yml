      If the mail add-in is running on the Outlook desktop client or Outlook for iOS, the hostVersion property returns
      the version of the host application, Outlook. In Outlook Web App, the property returns the version of the Exchange
      Server. An example is the string 15.0.468.0.

      Gets a string that represents the current view of Outlook Web App.


      The returned string can be one of the following values: OneColumn, TwoColumns, or ThreeColumns.


      If the host application is not Outlook Web App, then accessing this property results in undefined.


      Outlook Web App has three views that correspond to the width of the screen and the window, and the number of
      columns that can be displayed:


      - OneColumn, which is displayed when the screen is narrow. Outlook Web App uses this single-column layout on the
      entire screen of a smartphone.


      - TwoColumns, which is displayed when the screen is wider. Outlook Web App uses this view on most tablets.


      - ThreeColumns, which is displayed when the screen is wide. For example, Outlook Web App uses this view in a full
      screen window on a desktop computer.
