    summary: >-
      If provided, specifies the number of units by which the range or selection
      is to be moved. If `count` is a positive number, the object is collapsed
      to its end position and moved backward in the document by the specified
      number of units. If `count` is a negative number, the object is collapsed
      to its start position and moved forward by the specified number of units.
      The default value is 1. You can also control the collapse direction by
      using the [Selection.collapse](xref:word!Word.Selection:class) method
      before using the `move` method. If the range or selection is in the middle
      of a unit or isn't collapsed, moving it to the beginning or end of the
      unit counts as moving it one full unit.
