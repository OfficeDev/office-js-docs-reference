  // The following example checks whether a location is specified in an appointment before it's sent.
  function onAppointmentSendHandler(event) {
      Office.context.mailbox.item.location.getAsync({ asyncContext: event }, asyncResult => {
          const event = asyncResult.asyncContext;
          if (asyncResult.status === Office.AsyncResultStatus.Failed) {
              console.log(asyncResult.error.message);
              // If the add-in is unable to retrieve the appointment's location, the appointment isn't sent.
              event.completed({ allowEvent: false, errorMessage: "Failed to get the appointment's location." });
              return;
          }

          if (asyncResult.value === "") {
              // If no location is specified, the appointment isn't sent and the user is alerted to include a location.
              event.completed(
                  {
                      allowEvent: false,
