      \*\*Important\*\*:

      - The `contentId` property is only supported in Outlook on the web, the new Outlook on Windows, and classic Outlook on Windows (preview). To preview the `contentId` property in classic Outlook on Windows, your Outlook client must run Version 2510 (Build 19312.20000) or later and must be on the Beta Channel. For more information, see [Microsoft 365 Insider Program](https://aka.ms/Msft365InsiderProgram)<!-- -->.

      - Changes to how inline images are represented in the HTML body of Outlook emails in Outlook on the web and the new Outlook on Windows released on November 15, 2025. Previously, the attachment ID of the image appeared in the `src` attribute of the applicable `<img>` element. Now, the image is represented by a content ID (`cid`<!-- -->) in the `src` attribute instead. If you parse the attachment ID from the HTML editor or get the Base64-encoded value of the image from the URL in the `src` attribute, you must update your add-in's parsing logic. For more information, see [Changes to inline image representation in Outlook on the web and new Outlook for Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/microsoft365dev/changes-to-inline-images-in-outlook)<!-- -->.

      Gets the MIME content type of the attachment.

      \*\*Warning\*\*: While the `contentType` value is a direct lookup of the attachment's extension, the internal mapping isn't actively maintained so this property has been deprecated. If you require specific types, grab the attachment's extension and process accordingly.
