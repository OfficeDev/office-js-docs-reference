    summary: >-
      The settings created by using the methods of the RoamingSettings object are saved per add-in and per user. That
      is, they are available only to the add-in that created them, and only from the user's mail box in which they are
      saved.


      While the Outlook add-in API limits access to these settings to only the add-in that created them, these settings
      should not be considered secure storage. They can be accessed by Exchange Web Services or Extended MAPI. They
      should not be used to store sensitive information such as user credentials or security tokens.


      The name of a setting is a String, while the value can be a String, Number, Boolean, null, Object, or Array.


      The RoamingSettings object is accessible via the roamingSettings property in the Office.context namespace.


      Important: The RoamingSettings object is initialized from the persisted storage only when the add-in is first
      loaded. For task panes, this means that it is only initialized when the task pane first opens. If the task pane
      navigates to another page or reloads the current page, the in-memory object is reset to its initial values, even
      if your add-in has persisted changes. The persisted changes will not be available until the task pane is closed
      and reopened.

      Saves the settings.


      Any settings previously saved by an add-in are loaded when it is initialized, so during the lifetime of the
      session you can just use the set and get methods to work with the in-memory copy of the settings property bag.
      When you want to persist the settings so that they are available the next time the add-in is used, use the
      saveAsync method.

      Sets or creates the specified setting.


      The set method creates a new setting of the specified name if it does not already exist, or sets an existing
      setting of the specified name. The value is stored in the document as the serialized JSON representation of its
      data type.


      A maximum of 32KB is available for the settings of each add-in.


      Any changes made to settings using the set function will not be saved to the server until the saveAsync function
      is called.
