      Represents a collection of entities found in an email message or appointment. Read mode only.


      The Entities object is a container for the entity arrays returned by the getEntities and getEntitiesByType methods
      when the item (either an email message or an appointment) contains one or more entities that have been found by
      the server. You can use these entities in your code to provide additional context information to the viewer, such
      as a map to an address found in the item, or to open a dialer for a phone number found in the item.


      If no entities of the type specified in the property are present in the item, the property associated with that
      entity is null. For example, if a message contains a street address and a phone number, the addresses property and
      phoneNumbers property would contain information, and the other properties would be null.


      To be recognized as an address, the string must contain a United States postal address that has at least a subset
      of the elements of a street number, street name, city, state, and zip code.


      To be recognized as a phone number, the string must contain a North American phone number format.


      Entity recognition relies on natural language recognition that is based on machine learning of large amounts of
      data. The recognition of an entity is non-deterministic and success sometimes relies on the particular context in
      the item.


      When the property arrays are returned by the getEntitiesByType method, only the property for the specified entity
      contains data; all other properties are null.
