      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the

      contains either the attachment identifier or a code that indicates any error that occurred while attaching the
      item. You can use the options parameter to pass state information to the callback method, if needed.


      You can subsequently use the identifier with the removeAttachmentAsync method to remove the attachment in the same
      session.


      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook Web App, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to items
      other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.

      Note: In Outlook on the web, if the item is an appointment and it has previously been saved using saveAsync, the
      user is prompted to save, discard, or cancel even if no changes have occurred since the item was last saved.

      Asynchronously saves an item.


      When invoked, this method saves the current message as a draft and returns the item id via the callback method. In
      Outlook Web App or Outlook in online mode, the item is saved to the server. In Outlook in cached mode, the item is
      saved to the local cache.


      Since appointments have no draft state, if saveAsync is called on an appointment in compose mode, the item will be
      saved as a normal appointment on the user's calendar. For new appointments that have not been saved before, no
      invitation will be sent. Saving an existing appointment will send an update to added or removed attendees.


      Note: If your add-in calls saveAsync on an item in compose mode in order to get an itemId to use with EWS or the
      REST API, be aware that when Outlook is in cached mode, it may take some time before the item is actually synced
      to the server. Until the item is synced, using the itemId will return an error.


      Note: The following clients have different behavior for saveAsync on appointments in compose mode:


      - Mac Outlook does not support saveAsync on a meeting in compose mode. Calling saveAsync on a meeting in Mac
      Outlook will return an error.


      - Outlook on the web always sends an invitation or update when saveAsync is called on an appointment in compose
      mode.
