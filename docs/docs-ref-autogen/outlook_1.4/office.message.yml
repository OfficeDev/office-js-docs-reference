      Gets an identifier for the email conversation that contains a particular message.


      You can get an integer for this property if your mail app is activated in read forms or responses in compose
      forms. If subsequently the user changes the subject of the reply message, upon sending the reply, the conversation
      ID for that message will change and that value you obtained earlier will no longer apply.


      You get null for this property for a new item in a compose form. If the user sets a subject and saves the item,
      the conversationId property will return a value.
