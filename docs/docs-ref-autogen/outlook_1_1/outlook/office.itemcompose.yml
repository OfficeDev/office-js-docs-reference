      Adds an Exchange item, such as a message, as an attachment to the message or appointment.


      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the
      compose form. If you specify a callback method, the method is called with one parameter, asyncResult, which
      contains either the attachment identifier or a code that indicates any error that occurred while attaching the
      item. You can use the options parameter to pass state information to the callback method, if needed.


      You can subsequently use the identifier with the removeAttachmentAsync method to remove the attachment in the same
      session.


      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook on the web, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to
      items other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.
