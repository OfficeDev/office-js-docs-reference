      Adds a file to a message or appointment as an attachment.


      The addFileAttachmentAsync method uploads the file at the specified URI and attaches it to the item in the compose
      form.


      You can subsequently use the identifier with the removeAttachmentAsync method to remove the attachment in the same
      session.


      **Important**: In recent builds of Outlook on Windows, a bug was introduced that incorrectly appends an
      `Authorization: Bearer` header to this action (whether using this API or the Outlook UI). To work around this
      issue, you can try using the `addFileAttachmentFromBase64` API introduced with requirement set 1.8.

      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the

      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook on the web, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to
