    summary: >-
      In Outlook on the web and the new Outlook on Windows, the body mode
      depends on the user's current setting for message organization (that is,
      messages are organized as conversations or individual messages). If
      messages are organized by conversation, it specifies the body of the
      current reply. Conversely, if messages are organized as individual
      messages, it specifies the entire body of a message, including previous
      messages from the same conversation thread.


      In Outlook on mobile, specifies the body of the current reply.
    value: '1'
