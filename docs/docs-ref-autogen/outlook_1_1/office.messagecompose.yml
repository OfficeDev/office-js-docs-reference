      Adds an Exchange item, such as a message, as an attachment to the message or appointment.


      The addItemAttachmentAsync method attaches the item with the specified Exchange identifier to the item in the
      compose form. If you specify a callback method, the method is called with one parameter, asyncResult, which
      contains either the attachment identifier or a code that indicates any error that occurred while attaching the
      item. You can use the options parameter to pass state information to the callback method, if needed.


      You can subsequently use the identifier with the removeAttachmentAsync method to remove the attachment in the same
      session.


      If your Office add-in is running in Outlook Web App, the addItemAttachmentAsync method can attach items to items
      other than the item that you are editing; however, this is not supported and is not recommended.

      The removeAttachmentAsync method removes the attachment with the specified identifier from the item. As a best
      practice, you should use the attachment identifier to remove an attachment only if the same mail app has added
      that attachment in the same session. In Outlook Web App and OWA for Devices, the attachment identifier is valid
      only within the same session. A session is over when the user closes the app, or if the user starts composing in
      an inline form and subsequently pops out the inline form to continue in a separate window.
