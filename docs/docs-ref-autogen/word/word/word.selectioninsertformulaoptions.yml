      If provided, specifies the mathematical formula you want the [= (Formula)
      field](https://support.microsoft.com/office/32d5c9de-3516-4ec3-80ed-d1fc2b5bc21d)
      to evaluate. The `formula` property is optional only if the selection is
      in a cell and there is at least one cell that contains a value above or to
      the left of the cell that contains the insertion point. If the cells above
      the insertion point contain values, the inserted field is
      `{=SUM(ABOVE)}`<!-- -->; if the cells to the left of the insertion point
      contain values, the inserted field is `{=SUM(LEFT)}`<!-- -->. If both the
      cells above the insertion point and the cells to the left of it contain
      values, Microsoft Word uses the following rules to determine which `SUM`
      function to insert.


      - If the cell immediately above the insertion point contains a value, Word
      inserts `{=SUM(ABOVE)}`<!-- -->.


      - If the cell immediately above the insertion point doesn't contain a
      value but the cell immediately to the left of the insertion point does,
      Word inserts `{=SUM(LEFT)}`<!-- -->.


      - If neither cell immediately above the insertion point nor the cell
      immediately below it contains a value, Word inserts `{=SUM(ABOVE)}`<!--
      -->.


      - If you don't specify the `formula` property and all the cells above and
      to the left of the insertion point are empty, using the `= (Formula)`
      field causes an error.
