      Determines whether Excel will delay the batch request until the user exits cell edit mode.


      When false, if the user is in cell edit when the batch request is processed by the host, the batch will
      automatically fail. When true, the batch request will be executed immediately if the user is not in cell edit
      mode, but if the user is in cell edit mode the batch request will be delayed until the user exits cell edit mode.
